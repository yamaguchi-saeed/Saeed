# Saeed
Hello  ðŸ‘‹, My name is Saeed.

I am an aspiring software engineer with moderate expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and  React. I have also worked with Figma and Webflow, demonstrating a strong foundation in UX/UI design. My experience extends to machine learning and AI model development, with tangible projects showcasing my skills. I am currently in the Advanced Computer Graphics and Digital Human Laboratory in Ritsumeikan University where I am researching on Dynamic Sign Language Recognition using MediaPipe and LSTM models.

Additionally, I possess knowledge in databases and  programming in Python and Java. In a leadership role, I led a university lab project three times which were all successful. One case was a project where we successfully created a Python-based image project, while I work  as  the leader and the head programmer for the team. Another was a react based project and the last was a Javascript project. Now in my fourth year of university, I continue to expand my skills and contribute meaningfully to projects. I'm currently diving into AWS at a beginner level.
